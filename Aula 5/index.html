        <h1>Golden Strawberries</h1>
        <p>I do not believe that it is statistically possible to get 7c golden strawberry without using assist mode, or cheating in some way. I kinda think that Matt Thorson was trolling us by putting this strawberry in the game, and having no way to tell if someone is using assist mode just by looking at the screen footage. I think he knows full well that it's impossible, and the whole thing is little more than a social experiment to see how many people will cheat and then try to pass their work off as legitimate. There is no achievement or reward for getting this strawberry. You don't unlock a special ending where Theo chips a tooth on the gold 7c strawberry in your pie. You do get a stamp of a gold strawberry on your save file if you succeed in getting 7c golden strawberry. But PC players have already learned to hack their save slot to manipulate these stamps - including removing the assist stamp.</p>

        <h2>How do i get into the collector's list?</h1>
        <p2>To get on the Collectors' List, all that is required is permanent video evidence of you collecting Farewell's Golden Strawberry. The video must show the whole run from start to finish, and no Assists or Variants are allowed to be used during the run.</p>
